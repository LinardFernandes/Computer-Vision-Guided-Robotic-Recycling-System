# Computer-Vision-Guided-Robotic-Recycling-System
A low-cost robotic system that uses ESP32-CAM and Arduino to automate waste segregation. It employs a MobileNetV2 FOMO model for real-time detection of recyclables like plastic, paper, and aluminum, achieving 94% accuracy. The 3D-printed robotic arm efficiently sorts waste, improving recycling efficiency with edge AI.
